In the previous post, we discussed how Asymptotic analysis overcomes the problems of the naive way of analyzing algorithms. In this post, we will take an example of Linear Search and analyze it using Asymptotic analysis.
We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm: 
1) The Worst Case 
2) Average Case 
3) Best Case
Let us consider the following implementation of Linear Search.
